# Breakpoint
iOS application to log urges to engage in habits you want to replace.

## Origin
I used to chew my nails every day. It was painful and sometimes bloody, and I had been doing it for a good 7 years. Then I decided to grab a pen and paper and write down every time I felt the urge to chew my nails.

I kept track of time of day, context (what I was doing, who I was with, thoughts in my head...) and something I chose to do instead. It only took a week to completely eliminate any desire to bring my fingers towards my mouth.

## What does the MVP do
Breakpoint is the next level for this "habit replacement notebook" I used to keep.

The user can register any number of habits they want to replace and log every time they feel the urge to engage in any of them.

When registering a habit, they can also predefine any number of Replacement Strategy steps to complete instead of engaging in the habit.

Upon logging the urge, the user can choose from their list of habits, set the time of day, type in a context and choose any of 3 resolutions:
- pending: urge has been logged but no action has been taken on it.
- not handled: even though the urge has been logged, the user could not replace the habit this time.
- handled: the habit has been successfully replaced this time.

Now, the user has a timeline view of all occurrences of urges they felt on their day to day and all resolutions applied to them, helping them achieve clarity on what triggers such habits and what kinds of strategies best work to handle these urges.

The goal is that the user can build enough self-awareness to automatically not engage in the harmful habits anymore. The ultimate goal of Breakpoint is that people don't depend on it for long.
